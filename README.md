# RubiksCube

Rubiks Cube solver algorithm made by an old student of University of Central Florida.

## Objectif

The aim of the modifications of the source code is to adapt the output to use it for an online rubiks cube solver.

## Changes

Invertion of the original output because it didn't work.

## How to use it ?

### Compilation

Write in command line :
make build
make

### Use the program

Before execute the main file, you need to know where your cubies are on your cube.
You can execute the twist executable (command line : ./bin/twist) to know it. You just need to know the scramble made (note that you need to do the scramble with the green face in front of you and the white face to the top).
Once executed, insert the scramble in the output of the program and copy one of the result.

You can now execute the main executable : ./bin/executable
Enter the saved result and now wait the answer. It will be printed in "solution.txt".
